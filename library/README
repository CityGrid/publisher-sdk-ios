The tests run in Simulation mode (i.e. [CityGrid setSimulation:YES]). These
files are in Library/Simulation/* and the simulation mode will take the
URL and map it to the file name by converting the URI to a file where the
/ characters are replaced by _ characters.

i.e. here is how a simulation is mapped to a file
