Requirments
- A Mac with Lion (although Snow Leopard still works)
- Xcode 4.1 (although 4.0.2 still works)

There are two projects as part of the iOS SDK.
- library
- example

Run ./distribute.sh to build a dmg that can be shared and uploaded.

The library directory contains the code to build the actual library (Static Framework)
itself. You could also build it independently using the Xcode project or
the library/distribute.sh.

The example directory contains the code to build an example app that uses the
framework in the same manner that a developer might use it. This is built and
directly using Xcode. The framework can be copied from the library directory
using example/update.sh.

Please, note after running ./distribute.sh the CityGrid binary file will be
updated as Xcode compiles it uniquely each time.

Versioning
To update the versions they can be updated in 3 places.
./distribute.sh (DMG_NAME)
./library/distribute.sh (FRAMEWORK_VERSION, FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION)
./example/Application/CGEInfo.plist (CFBundleVersion, CFBundleShortVersionString)

Note, the FRAMEWORK_VERSION and CFBundleShortVersionString) should just be
incremented for each release. It also needs to be unique even across all
branches.
